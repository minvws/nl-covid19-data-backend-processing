# Introduction
The coronavirus dashboard gives up-to-date information about the development of the coronavirus in the Netherlands. It was launched 5 june 2020. Read more about the dashboard on: https://coronadashboard.rijksoverheid.nl/over.

With the information on the dashboard, early signs that the rate of infection is increasing can be picked up. This project describes the definitions and calculations on various indicators to that purpose. See https://coronadashboard.rijksoverheid.nl/verantwoording for even more information on data calculation and presentation for the corona dashboard.

In this section, you can find out which indicators the dashboard uses, where the numbers of these indicators originate from, why we’ve made certain design and tech choices in order to get to the figures that you see in the [dashboard](https://coronadashboard.rijksoverheid.nl/).

<ins>Technical and functional requirements</ins> <br>
The backend was made in assignment of the Ministry of Healthcare and Sports of the Netherlands. We wanted to make a very robust application and hence chosen to export the data from the database in JSON format and to be made available for the front end application. The respective repository can be found [here](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-data-dashboard). The requirements for the back-end and front-end are all according to the RIVM standards, since the requirement was to be able to migrate the Corona dashboard to the RIVM infrastructure. In addition, for the architecture design of the back-end we have chosen robustness over speed, since we wanted to minimize the loss of data integrity and minimize security risk. Hence, before the data is published online the data is checked by RIVM and the Ministery. 

For most figures, we simply take the source data and apply little to no transformations to it. At most, we would add an extra date or replace a date with its UNIX counterpart. However, for some indicators we need to make a calculation, e.g. to calculate the 3 day averages. In this section we try to explain as much as possible what we have done in that case. Furthermore, we have also made sure that you can also check the [source code](./main/sql/stored_procedures/). In addition to the source code, we have also supplied the locations where you can find the data yourself. For the data sources not available online, we have provided a [folder](./resources/) that contains the original source files. We provide these files as an example and will not be updated regularly. We are working on getting these sources available to the general public. In general, any user should be able to recreate the figures that are shown in the dashboard.

## Static data

Two static data files are used in combination with the above transactional data. 
1. The number of citizens per security region; these numbers originate from 01-01-2020. In the current version, this will not (yet) get updated on a regular basis.
2. A list of which municipalities belong to a specific security region. This is currently a static data set, which is not updated.
3. A list of the combination between the code and the name of the sewage treatment plant (RWZI_AWZI_CODE and RWZI_AWZI_NAME).
